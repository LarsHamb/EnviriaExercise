# Enviria Flutter Take Home Exercise
This exercise aims to evaluate your Flutter development skills. You'll build a simple application using a provided JSON dataset, demonstrating your understanding of core Flutter concepts and best practices.

## Tasks
-  **JSON Parsing:** Parse the provided JSON data. This simulates an upstream API which sends you data that you do not have control over. 
- **UI Development:** Create a visually appealing, vertically scrollable UI to display the parsed data. Please see the UI wireframe below. Use placeholders while data is loading. 
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Implement a pull-to-refresh mechanism to allow users to fetch updated data.
- **Sorting:** Add a button to sort events by their start times, either in ascending or descending order.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Ensure that the displayed data elements are unique, eliminating duplicates.
- **Testing** Write tests to verify the correctness and reliability of your code.

### Additional Considerations 
- **UI Customization:** Feel free to customize the UI appearance with colors, fonts, and spacing that align with your design preferences.
- **Architectural Choice:** Select an appropriate architecture to structure your code effectively.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios.
